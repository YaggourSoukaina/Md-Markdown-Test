# Md-Markdown-Test

`render-md-mermaid` will pick up any Mermaid graph in Markdown files that is defined as:

~~~markdown
![rendered image description](relative/path/to/rendered_image. svg or png )
<details>
  <summary>diagram source</summary>
  This details block is collapsed by default when viewed in GitHub. This hides the mermaid graph definition, while the rendered image
  linked above is shown. The details tag has to follow the image tag. (newlines allowed)

```mermaid
gantt
    title A Gantt Diagram
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Section
    A task           :a1, 2014-01-01, 30d
    Another task     :after a1  , 20d
    section Another
    Task in sec      :2014-01-12  , 12d
    another task      : 24d
```   
  
</details>
~~~

The script will pick up the graph definition from the mermaid code block and render it to the image file and path specified in the
image tag using [mermaid-cli](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli). The rendered image can be in svg or png format, whatever is specified will be generated. The result is displayed like this:

![rendered image description](relative/path/to/rendered_image.png)
<details>
  <summary>diagram source</summary>
